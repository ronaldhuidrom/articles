   <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>Ever since the dawn of history of science, women have been making a lot of significant contributions to the development of science and human civilization. In this article, we shall look at some of their contributions which shaped the history of science and some of the most accomplished but largely forgotten women scientists and mathematicians. The article will follow a linear chronological order as we look into many of the notable women and their work in shaping the history and development of science and mathematics.</p>
  <h4>Ancient Greece, Babylon and Egypt</h4>
  <p>One of the earliest accounts of women in science dates back to ancient Greece. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agamede">Agamede</a> was cited by Homer as a healer in ancient Greece before the Trojan War (c. 1194-1184 BCE). One late antique legend has it that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnodice">Agnodice</a> was the first female physician to practice legally in fourth century BCE Athens.</p>

  <p>Women could freely study natural philosophy (the precursor of natural sciences) in ancient Greece was open to women. Historical records include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aglaonice">Aglaonike</a>, astronomer, who predicted eclipses and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theano_(philosopher)">Theano</a>, mathematician and physician, who was a pupil of Pythagoras (one of the most important mathematicians in history).  </p>

  <p>Around 1200 BCE during Babylonian civilization, two perfumeresses were able to obtain the essences from plants by using extraction and distillation procedures. The Egyptian dynasty accounts women who were involved in applied chemistry, such as the making of beer and the preparation of medicinal compounds. Women have been recorded to have made major contributions to alchemy (the precusor of modern-day chemistry). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_the_Jewess">Mary the Jewess</a> is the most famous of the women alchemist; she has been credited with inventing several chemical instruments, including the double boiler, a distillation equipment of that time.</p>

  <p>Women also made marks in philosophy and mathematics. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypatia">Hypatia of Alexandria</a> (c. 350-415 CE) is the earliest known female mathematician about whom detailed information has survived. She is credited with writing several important commentaries on geometry, algebra and astronomy. </p>

  <h4>Medieval Europe and Scientific Revolution</h4>

  <p>When the first universities emerged in 11th century, women were, for the most part, excluded from university education. The Italian University of Bologna was an exception; they allowed women to attend lectures since its inception, in 1088. The attitute of educating women in medical fiends in Italy was more liberal than in other places, leading to notable female physicians such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorotea_Bucca">Dorotea Bucca</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trotula">Trotula di Ruggiero</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scientific Revolution of the 1600s and 1700s also saw the rise of notable women in alchemy, philosophy and natural sciences. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_Cortese">Isabella Cortese</a>, an Italian alchemist, was able to manipulate nature in order to create several medicinal, alchemy and cosmetic "secrets" or experiments. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Brahe">Sophia Brahe</a> taught herself astronomy by studying books in German and her observations led to the discovery of the Supernova SN 1572 which helped refute the geocentric model of the universe.</p>

  <p>Despite many notable women contributions, the Scientific Revolution did little to change people's ideas about women in science. Women were often depicted as both innately emotional and incapable of objective reasoning, or as natural mothers reproducing a natural, moral society.</p>

  <h4>18th and 19th Century</h4>
  <p>According to Britannica, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Gaetana_Agnesi">Maria Gaetana Agnesi</a> is "considered to be the first woman in the Western world to have achieved a reputation in mathematics"; she is credited as the first woman to write a mathematics handbook giving a systematic illustration of the different results and theorems of infinitesimal calculus. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89milie_du_Ch%C3%A2telet">Émilie du Châtelet</a> was the first scientist to appreciate the significance of kinetic energy, as opposed to momentum. In 1749, she completed the French translation of Newton's Principia. The astronomer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Herschel">Caroline Herschel</a> discovered eight comets during 1786-97.</p>

  <p>Science remained a largely amateur profession during the early part of the nineteenth century. Botany was considered a popular and fashionable activity, and one particularly suitable to women. However, as the nineteenth century progressed, botany and other sciences became increasingly professionalized, and women were increasingly excluded.</p>

  <p>English mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a> made contributions to Charles Babbage's Analytic Engine; she is credited to be the first computer programmer. But a large proportion of the most successful women in the STEM fields in the second half of the 19th century were Russians. The mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofya_Kovalevskaya">Sofia Kovalevskaia</a> (1850-1891), was the first woman in 19th century Europe to receive a doctorate in mathematics and the first to become a university professor in any field.</p>
